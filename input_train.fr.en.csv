I have ""relapsed"" several months later. I then repeated 3 years later an appointment with an ENT prescribed me as the nasonex. the desired effect was not at the rendezvous (addiction was much longer than the first time) and I ' I quickly abandoned (those who have the same addiction as I know how painful it is to live with a stuffy nose sore accompanying the head). Tuesday, March 24 at 20h, I decided to end my addiction to nasal drops. Obviously, the first 24 hours were very painful (especially headaches), but it was gradually bearable. at present, I am in my fourth day off and although I have a clear nostril at 90%, I always another completely blocked nostril from the start and I almost many once ""relapse"" in the lead. I take from time to time when breathing becomes difficult oral nasal decongestants (which it does not cause nor support the drug rhinitis) but its effect is quite limited. all this to come back to my original question: what is the average time to find a nose completely led after stopping the medicine?

"6820","Good evening, I guess this is recurring, but being very anxious (and very tired), I can not help to explain the situation without all the pages of the forum (it's been 20 minutes I turn on different sites & amp , forums). so here goes: I 20 & amp; I take the pill leeloo gen for about 1 year now. I had never forgotten far. the only problem is the appearance of brown spots 2 times (with a cycle without problems between the two) - the largest & amp; earlier the 2nd time. my gynecologist confirmed to me that this could come from a progesterone deficiency (since I'm not very thick - progesterone is stored in the fat & amp; is responsible for fixing the egg into the uterus if pregnant, pill therefore aims to bring down the rate at end of cycle, but is deficient this rate tends to fall sooner than expected home, and thus provoke me pre-menstrual blood loss - and I some eating disorders - and the not very glorious ""anorexic""). thus a priori, not really risk that I get pregnant, I even afraid to end barren by the time that I want children. but now, last Sunday night, I slept exceptionally at my boyfriend (we unfortunately still lives with his parents each). it fell by chance stack the day I was to start a new pack (my week off was ending Sunday evening at 22h when I take my pill). and I am much stressed, I took the usually leave it on my desk (usually prominently) because I am afraid of losing in the lugging everywhere I go by putting it in my purse. and although yet still so stressed & amp; if zany (thus everything has a place in my room & amp; I make a list every time I go somewhere), I do not know how I managed, but I forgot my pills with me .. I obviously I am at once realized my boyfriend (at 18h, he lives in 2h transport home - that is no way to reverse gear, pharmacy closed and not my prescription on me). I panic, crying, stress, but my boyfriend told me too bad, use condoms. on my way home on Monday evening, I take away the forgotten tablet & amp; I read 2-3 times the manual of my pill: I have to use condoms in addition to my pill for 7 days. but here certainly last Monday of the sudden, my boyfriend did not ejaculate in me, and luckily the Friday before we had put a condom just to ejaculation (to avoid the race to the toilet in front of my parents .. brief ). So me & amp; I have reflected implacable logic: if the pill blocks fertilization for 7 days, only our antics Monday involve risk. or there was no ejaculation .. I also sought the maximum life span of a sperm cell in the human body (well women say): 3 to 4 days on average (so Monday + 4 = Friday = still protected by my last pill effective Saturday evening for 7 days off) but observed a maximum of 7 days (IAH Monday + 7 = Monday, and protected only until Saturday) .. again, I had a big doubt seeing the forum discussions: I never really understood what was the ""pre-cum"" ?? When I spoke last weekend with my boyfriend, he told me there would be no risk because it would put the condom as soon as he feel he would enjoy (it does not support condoms) but can it really comes out when the pre-cum ?? Is it a risk of pregnancy ?? hum in short, despite all my précotions & amp; my progesterone deficiency, do you think that there is a small risk of pregnancy ?? thank you in advance for answers, stressed the great I'm rises in 6h & amp; can not close my eyes ..
